### Setup Code

``` r
library(tidyverse)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 6,
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)

scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

### Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The instacart dataset is quite large, with 15 columns and 1384617 rows.
The table is structured with each row corresponding to a single item
ordered from instacart and the associated information for that single
item. Some key variables are “order\_id,” “user\_id,” “product\_name,”
“aisle\_id,” department\_id," “aisle,” and “department.” For example,
the first item in the table is given the number 1, order\_id is 1,
user\_id is 112108, product\_name is Bulgarian Yogurt, aisle\_id is 120,
department\_id is 16, aisle is yogurt, and department is dairy eggs. As
made clear by this example, important variables take both numeric and
alphabetic forms. Certain columns will also be made up of distinct data
while others will have a few highly repeated categories.

``` r
distinct(instacart, aisle_id)
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 1
    ##    aisle_id
    ##       <int>
    ##  1      120
    ##  2      108
    ##  3       83
    ##  4       95
    ##  5       24
    ##  6       21
    ##  7        2
    ##  8      115
    ##  9       53
    ## 10      123
    ## # … with 124 more rows
